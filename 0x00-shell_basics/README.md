0x00. Shell basics
==================

This project introduces **shell basics**: navigating the filesystem (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`), creating and removing directories and files (`mkdir`, `rm`, `touch`), and listing in different formats. All tasks are shell commands or scripts.

Each task is a single command or short script that performs a basic shell operation: e.g. print current working path, list files, change directory, create a directory, create an empty file, or list in long format. The goal is to get comfortable with the shell. Run: execute the script (e.g. `./0-current_working_directory`) or run the commands as specified in the task description.
